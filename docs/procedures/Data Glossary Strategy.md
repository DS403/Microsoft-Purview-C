# Data Glossary Strategy 

---

## 1. Introduction:
   The Data Glossary Strategy outlines our approach to standardizing and managing data terminologies within our organization. A data glossary serves as a centralized repository of definitions for data-related terms, ensuring consistency and clarity in communication across different teams and departments. This documentation provides insights into our strategy, including the systems and domains covered by the glossary and the implementation process for capturing and managing glossary terms.

## 2. Tracked Systems:
   Currently, our data glossary tracks terms across the following systems:

   - **AFS (Apparel and Footwear Solution):**
   - **APS (Advanced Planning and Scheduling):**
   - **MDG (Master Data Governance):**
   - **PLM (Product Lifecycle Management):**

   These systems represent key components of our data ecosystem, and tracking glossary terms within them helps ensure that data terminology is standardized and consistent across various business functions and processes.

## 3. Domains Covered:
   Our data glossary spans across various domains, including:

   - **Material-Product**
   - **Supplier**
   - **Customer**
   - **Site**
   - **Finance**
   - **Purchase Info Record**
   - **Source-List**

   By covering a wide range of domains, we aim to address the diverse needs of different teams and departments within the organization, ensuring that glossary terms are relevant and applicable across various business contexts.

## 4. Implementation of Glossary Terms:
   The current implementation of glossary terms involves a collaborative process between the business and data management teams. We receive definitions from business stakeholders tied to specific tables and fields within the tracked systems. Based on these definitions, we create glossary terms that accurately capture the meaning and usage of each data element. Each glossary term is associated with metadata such as its domain, system, and related tables/fields, providing context and facilitating easy reference.

## 5. Governance and Maintenance:
   Our data glossary is governed and maintained through a structured process to ensure accuracy, relevance, and consistency over time. Regular reviews and updates are conducted to incorporate changes in business requirements, data models, or system configurations. Additionally, data stewards are responsible for overseeing the governance of the glossary, including approving new terms, resolving conflicts, and addressing any issues or discrepancies that arise.

## 6. Integration with Data Management Processes:
   The data glossary is closely integrated with our data management processes, including data modeling, data integration, and data governance. Glossary terms serve as a foundational component of data modeling efforts, providing clear definitions and context for data elements. They also support data integration by facilitating mapping and transformation activities. Furthermore, glossary terms contribute to data governance by promoting standardization, consistency, and understanding of data assets across the organization.

## 7. Conclusion:
   The Data Glossary Strategy is essential for promoting data literacy, standardization, and governance within our organization. By tracking glossary terms across key systems and domains and implementing a collaborative process for capturing and managing definitions, we ensure that data terminology is clear, consistent, and aligned with business objectives. This enables effective communication, decision-making, and collaboration across different teams and departments, ultimately driving better business outcomes.
