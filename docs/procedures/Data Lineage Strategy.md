# Data Lineage Strategy 

---

## 1. Introduction:
   The Data Lineage Strategy outlines our approach to tracing and documenting the flow of data from its origin to its destination within our organization. Data lineage provides crucial insights into how data is sourced, transformed, and used across various systems and processes. This documentation provides an overview of our strategy, including the processes involved and the importance of capturing data lineage for data governance and compliance purposes.

## 2. Development Approach:
   Our approach to data lineage development involves working backward from Power BI (PBI) reports as the target and identifying the upstream data sources that contribute to these reports. By starting with PBI reports, which represent the end-user perspective and the final output of data analysis, we can trace the journey of data back to its sources, enabling us to understand how data is transformed and aggregated along the way. This approach ensures that our data lineage diagrams accurately reflect the actual data flow and dependencies within our organization.

## 3. Scanning Sources into the Catalog:
   To capture data lineage effectively, we need to scan each data source into the data catalog to capture its assets. By ingesting metadata from the source systems into the catalog, we create a comprehensive inventory of data assets, including tables, columns, files, and other resources. This catalog serves as the foundation for documenting and visualizing data lineage, allowing us to track the movement and transformation of data across the organization. By scanning sources into the catalog, we ensure that all relevant data assets are included in the data lineage analysis, providing a holistic view of data flow and dependencies.

## 4. Building Data Lineage :
   Once the sources are scanned into the catalog, we create data lineage using visual diagrams and textual descriptions. These lineage diagrams illustrate the flow of data from its origin to its destination, showing how data is transformed and aggregated at each step. Additionally, we can easily navigate to each data asset that involves in lineage by giving a click on switch to asset button which is available on the asset. Additionally, we can hide the unused assets from Data Lineage view.

## 5. Impact Analysis:
   Data lineage is not only essential for understanding data flow but also for conducting impact analysis. By tracing data lineage, we can identify the upstream and downstream impacts of changes to data sources, transformations, or business rules. This allows us to assess the potential risks and implications of proposed changes before implementation, minimizing the risk of data errors or inconsistencies.

## 6. Data Governance Integration:
   Our data lineage strategy is closely integrated with our data governance framework. Data lineage provides valuable insights into data quality, lineage, and usage, which are essential for effective data governance. By incorporating data lineage into our governance processes, we can ensure data integrity, compliance with regulations, and alignment with organizational goals and objectives.

## 7. Conclusion:
   The Data Lineage Strategy provides a structured approach to understanding the flow of data within our organization. By starting with PBI reports as the target and scanning data sources into the catalog, we can develop comprehensive data lineage diagrams that illustrate how data moves through our systems and processes. This understanding is crucial for ensuring data quality, compliance, and trustworthiness, ultimately supporting informed decision-making and strategic initiatives.
