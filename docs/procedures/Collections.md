## Managing Collection Hierarchy

Collections can be organized hierarchically to reflect the structure of your data. Follow these steps to manage the collection hierarchy:

1. Access the Purview portal.

## Assigning Data Assets to Collections

To enhance data organization, associate data assets with specific collections in Microsoft Purview. Open the Purview portal, navigate to the Data Catalog, and locate the desired data asset. Use the available options to assign the data asset to one or more collections. This functionality streamlines the categorization of data assets, contributing to a more structured and easily navigable data environment. By associating data assets with collections, users ensure a systematic approach to data governance and accessibility.
